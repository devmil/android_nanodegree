# Android Nanodegree

This repository contains all projects that are part of the Android Nanodegree course.

If the sub projects have to live in their own repositories then they get linked as submodules to this master project.

The apps referenced here (bedides the Capstone project) are not meant to be used productive in any way. They are just the result of each lesson.
